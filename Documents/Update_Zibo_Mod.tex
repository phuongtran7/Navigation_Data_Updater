\section{Procedures}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Go inside Zibo Mod installation folder\textbackslash plugins\textbackslash xlua\textbackslash scripts\textbackslash B738.fms\textbackslash.
	\item Open B738.fms.lua.
	\item Search for the string "cycle\_n".
	\item Increase the number of cycle by 1. For example, if "cycle\_n" = 32 then increase it to 32.
	\item Go down to "cycle\_data" and add one more entry at the end of the array.
	\item The first number of the new entry is the index, second is cycle number and third is active period.
	\item To find the cycle number open "earth\_nav.dat" in the "Output" folder. The cycle number will be on second line of the file.
	\item Go over: \url{https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/cifp/download/} and compare the cycle number to the zip file name to find the correct active period.
	\item Make sure to have a comma "," at the end of the previous entry of "cycle\_data" and have the correct indentation to the newly added entry.
	\item Start X-Plane and Zibo Mod to confirm the new database is working.
